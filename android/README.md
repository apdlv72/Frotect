Frotect Android App
=======

This is an Android app that ic capable of connectiong to the Arduino via Bluetooth and control its operation. 
If you are interested in teh Code, feel free to contact me. Did not yet release the code, because I need to
separate the code specific for Frotect from a larger App that I use to control different devices in my house 
(LED strips, garage door opener etc.).

For now you can find some screen shots of the main activity and various config and statistics dialogs.
